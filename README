A high-performance web-based geospatial visualization tool with an emphasis LEO satellites and lunar missions. Written in Rust to target WebGPU, with WebGL2 backwards compatibility.

## set up ANISE for geospatial library:

# This shell script sets up the development environment on Linux

curl https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit//C/PC_Linux_GCC_64bit/packages/cspice.tar.Z --output cspice.tar.Z
tar xzvf cspice.tar.Z
cd cspice
tcsh makeall.csh
mv lib/cspice.a lib/libcspice.a

# download data used by ANISE:

clone https://github.com/nyx-space/anise
cd anise
sudo apt-get install git-lfs
git-lfs pull
cp -r ./data ~/hypersphere/data

## To run the application locally:

WINIT_UNIX_BACKEND="x11" cargo watch -x "run"

## to compile for web:

wasm-pack build --target web

once compiled, serve your index.html page (I have been using live server)

## Upcoming features:

- Proper World Geodetic System implementation of globe
- model loading
- line / arc drawing
- add moon entity and map LRO images to surface (maybe a selenographic coordinate system?),
- add ability to switch view from earth to moon and also switch the target / observer for accurate relative location
- add time system for simulations including earth rotation and moon rotation
- host bsp data from server not from hardcoded file (or a better option will probably be allowing uploads of bsp data...)
- add subtle depth map to earth and atmosphere
