## To run the application locally:

```
WINIT_UNIX_BACKEND="x11" cargo watch -x  "run"
```

## to compile for web:

```
wasm-pack build --target web
```

once compiled, serve your index.html page (I have been using live server)

## Upcoming features:

- Proper World Geodetic System implementation of globe
- lat lon picking on click using inverse view matrix and ray-sphere intersection
- model loading
- line / arc drawing
- add time system for simulations (need to find out standard data format) including earth rotation
- add moon entity and map LRO images to surface (maybe a selenographic coordinate system?),
- add sun and maybe a simple ray tracer (need to look into performance on single thread, probably not great)
