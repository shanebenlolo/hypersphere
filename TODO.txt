The Road to ECS

1. follow ECS tutorial, figure out where systems live in relation to components. It looks like your components are
   correct but I think systems were implemented incorrectly (mainly their use of device is throwing a rench in things)

2. you'll want to remove all impls from your component data fields (CameraController, for instance)
   and place them in your corresponding System implementation

3. create a world, init in State, move components and maybe systems (maybe not?) into the world struct
   get rid of the idea of initing your components inside of World::new. Just make discrete functions like load_globe
   and have the systems create the data for components there and add them to the world state.

4. continue refactoring state. I'm not sure what to do with render pipeline yet, it may just stay in the global state
   unless I have a reason to want multiple render pipelines
